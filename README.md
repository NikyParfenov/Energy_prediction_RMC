# Energy_prediction_RMC
Pipeline for daily energy prediction of devices (only code, without data and model)

Each block of pipeline is a class-mixin with appropriate method. Final class is in pipeline.py.
To run prediction use run.py: 'python3 run.py -f <input_data.csv> -l 1' (-l 1 is optional to print logs in file)
